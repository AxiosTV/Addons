# Adding addon Guide
1. Create folder with *unique name*. (**Example**: faithful_mobs)
2. Add in folder image file and `info.yml`
3. Edit `info.yml`

In `info.yml`, if you don't have `any of URL`, leave it empty!

**TIP**: Use already added addons as template for yours, it will be easy for understand!
